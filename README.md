# Champions-Edu: AI Coding Assistants Educational Program

Welcome to the Champions-Edu repository - a comprehensive educational resource designed to train and develop expertise in AI-powered coding assistants and quality control practices.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains structured learning materials for two main educational tracks:

- **TA (Test Automation) Track**: Focused on AI coding assistants, tools, and practical implementation
- **QC (Quality Control) Track**: Centered on AI applications in quality assurance and testing
